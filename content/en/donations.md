# Support SciPy development

SciPy will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and
released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license. While we
have a large number of
[contributors](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/THANKS.txt)
who volunteer their time to improve SciPy, financial resources are
needed to run the project and accelerate its development. If you have
found SciPy useful in your work, research, or company, please consider
making a donation to the project commensurate with your resources. Any
amount helps!

If you are interested in donating to the project, you can use the
*PayPal* button below or click the \"Support NumFOCUS\" button at the
bottom our [homepage](http://www.numfocus.org/) (if you use the latter,
please indicate that you are donating to the SciPy project). All
donations will be used strictly to fund SciPy development, by supporting
activities such as developer sprints, documentation and maintenance
work, and paying for hosting costs of servers and build slaves.

Our donations are managed by the [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org)
foundation, which passes 90% of your contribution to the SciPy project,
and provides the SciPy development team with basic administrative and
legal services for the other 10%. NumFOCUS is a 501(c)3 non-profit
foundation, so if you are subject to the US Tax law, your contributions
are tax-deductible.

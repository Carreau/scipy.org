Support SciPy development
-------------------------

SciPy will always be 100% open source software, free for all to use and
released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.  While we have a
large number of `contributors <https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/THANKS.txt>`_ who
volunteer their time to improve SciPy, financial resources are needed to run
the project and accelerate its development.  If you have found SciPy to be
useful in your work, research or company, please consider making a donation to
the project commensurate with your resources. Any amount helps!  

If you are interested in donating to the project you can use the *Paypal*
button below or click the "Support NumFOCUS" button at the bottom our `homepage <http://www.numfocus.org/>`_
(if you use the latter, please indicate that you are donating to the SciPy
project).  All donations will be used strictly to fund SciPy development, by
supporting activities such as developer sprints, documentation and maintenance
work, and paying for hosting costs of servers and build slaves.

Our donations are managed by the `NumFOCUS`_ foundation, which passes 90% of
your contribution to the SciPy project, and provides the SciPy development team
with basic administrative and legal services for the other 10%.  NumFOCUS is a
501(c)3 non-profit foundation, so if you are subject to US Tax law, your
contributions are tax-deductible.
